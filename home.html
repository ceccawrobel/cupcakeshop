  <h1>Encinomanolo Cupcakes</h1>

  <p>Cupcakes were made cute for civilized folks. But who says hippies and health nuts don't deserve cute foods, too? Still cute, still dessert, but low-glycemic and gluten free and supposedly something a caveman could make, if a caveman had an oven. The perfect treat for your long-frozen friend visiting our 21st century.</p>
